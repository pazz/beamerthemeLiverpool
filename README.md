UoL LaTeX Beamer template
------------------------------------

This is a trap. There is no full beamer template yet but only a work-in-progress.

For the moment, there is only a stub `beamercolortheme` (beamercolorthemeLiverpool.sty)
that defines the corporate colours [from the brand-identity intranet site](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/intranet/brand-identity/brand-toolkit/corporate-colours).

The beamer docs are [here](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/beamer);
Contributions are welcome!
